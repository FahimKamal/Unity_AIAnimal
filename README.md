# Unity AI Animal
This NPC is another variant of AI People project. Functionality of this AI is the same and works almost the same way.
The NPCs are implemented through state pattern. They really on Waypoints to move from one place to another and each waypoints can assign a specific task to 
perform. At the moment tasks that I have assigned is: 
* Idle
* Eat 
* Sit

More activity can be added with them. All you have to create more different states.
